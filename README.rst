SouthernOcean-ARGO
==================

This repository contains the analysis scripts used for the paper *Characterizing the Seasonality of Phytoplankton Biomass in the Southern Ocean Observed by Biogeochemical Floats*. Uchida. T, D. Balwada, and R. Abernathey 2019, JGR: Oceans (`DOI`_). 
We provide the notebooks for quality control using `float 5904185 <SOCCOM/5904185.ipynb>`_ as a representative, `phytoplankton biomass over the whole dataset <Cphyto.ipynb>`_, and the timing of each spring bloom phase, viz. `onset, climax and apex <COMCLIMphasing.ipynb>`_.

The biogeochemical floats used in our study are operated by the SOCCOM and SOCLIM projects and data collected are available publicly by the International Argo Program and national programs tha contribute to it (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu, http://argo.jcommops.org). The data used in our paper were downloaded from the `SIO`_ and `SOCLIM`_ portal respectively.
